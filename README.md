# gov-api-fr
 A simple script to download and extract text from PDFs using the GovInfo API and PyMuPDF. Currently only works for the Federal Register but can easily be adapted for other collections.
 
 This solution is rough-and-ready but functional. Plans to add exception handling and some degree of parallelization using the asyncio library.
 
*** **For this script to run you need to obtain a GovInfo API key and set it as an environment variable. Information about the GovInfo API is available [here](https://api.govinfo.gov/docs/).** ***
